## 🔊 Audio System

Ancient Tiger features a complete audio system with background music and sound effects.

### Audio Files Required

Create a folder named `ancient_sfx` in the game directory and place these files:

| File | Type | Purpose | Duration |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| `ancient_bgm.mp3` | Music | Background music (loops continuously) | 2-5 min recommended |
| `shoot.wav` | SFX | Played when firing an orb | Short (< 0.5s) |
| `match.wav` | SFX | Played when orbs match and explode | Short (< 1s) |
| `combo.wav` | SFX | Played on combo multiplier ≥3 | Short (< 1s) |
| `power.wav` | SFX | Played when swapping orbs (right click) | Short (< 0.5s) |
| `game_over.wav` | SFX | Played when losing all lives | Medium (1-2s) |

### Audio Controls

- **Settings Menu**: Toggle music/SFX on/off
- **Volume Sliders**: Separate controls for music and sound effects
- **Pause Game**: Automatically pauses background music
- **Resume Game**: Resumes background music playback

### Testing Audio

Run the audio test script to verify your audio setup:

```bash
python test_audio.py
```

This will:
1. Check if all audio files exist
2. Show file sizes
3. Open a test window with buttons to test each sound
4. Display detailed debug information in console

### Troubleshooting Audio

**No sound at all:**
1. Check if `ancient_sfx` folder exists in game directory
2. Run `python test_audio.py` to diagnose the issue
3. Check console output for error messages
4. Verify audio files are not corrupted
5. Check system volume and audio output device

**Background music not playing:**
1. Make sure `ancient_bgm.mp3` exists in `ancient_sfx/`
2. Try converting to different format (MP3, OGG, WAV)
3. Check Settings menu - Music might be disabled
4. Check console for error messages (run game from terminal)

**Sound effects not playing:**
1. Verify all `.wav` files exist in `ancient_sfx/`
2. Check Settings menu - SFX might be disabled or volume at 0
3. Try re-exporting audio files with different settings
4. Some audio codecs might not be supported - try standard WAV format

**Common Issues:**
- **Codec not supported**: Re-export as standard WAV (PCM, 44100Hz, 16-bit)
- **File path wrong**: Make sure folder is named exactly `ancient_sfx`
- **Volume at 0**: Check both in-game settings and system volume
- **Files corrupted**: Try playing files in media player first

### Audio Features

- ✅ Looping background music
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous sound effects (up to 10)
- ✅ Independent volume controls
- ✅ Persistent settings (saved to JSON)
- ✅ Auto-pause on game pause
- ✅ No audio files = graceful fallback (game still playable)

### Getting Audio Files

**Option 1: Create Your Own**
- Use tools like Audacity, FL Studio, or GarageBand
- Export as MP3 (music) or WAV (sound effects)

**Option 2: Free Resources**
- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org) - Free sound effects
- [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org) - Free game audio
- [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com) - Royalty-free music

**Note**: Make sure you have the rights to use any audio files you add to the game.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
- **Mouse Movement**: Aim the shooter (always follows cursor)
- **Left Click**: Fire orb
- **Right Click**: Swap current orb with next orb
- **ESC**: Pause/Resume game

### Objective
Destroy all orbs in the chain before they reach the end portal by matching 3 or more orbs of the same color.

### Gameplay Features

**Slow Motion System** ⏱️
- When the chain reaches 85% of the path, the game automatically slows down
- Gives you more time to make precise shots
- Speed gradually decreases as danger increases
- Visual indicator: Red vignette and "⚠ DANGER! ⚠" warning

**Instant Pull Together** 🔗
- When orbs are destroyed, the chain immediately snaps back together
- No waiting for gaps to close
- 3x faster pull speed = more responsive gameplay

**Beginner Friendly** 🎯
- Level 1 starts with only 4 orbs
- Very slow initial speed (12 pixels/second)
- Orbs start far back (200 units from start)
- Faster projectile speed (600 units/second)
- Longer spawn interval (2.5 seconds between new orbs)

### Scoring
- **Base Score**: 10 points per orb destroyed
- **Combo Multiplier**: Up to 10x for consecutive matches
- **Chain Reactions**: Matches that create new matches earn bonus points

### Tips
- Plan ahead - look at your next orb
- Create chain reactions for massive combos
- Target clusters to trigger multiple matches
- Don't let the chain reach the portal!

## 🎨 Why No Graphical Assets?

Ancient Tiger uses **100% procedural graphics** for several important reasons:

### 1. **Educational Value**
This project demonstrates advanced procedural rendering techniques:
- `QPainter` mastery for custom graphics
- `QLinearGradient` and `QRadialGradient` for smooth color transitions
- Mathematical functions (`sin`, `cos`) for organic animations
- Real-time effect generation

### 2. **Zero Dependencies**
- No need to bundle image files
- Smaller application size
- No licensing concerns for graphics
- Easier distribution and deployment

### 3. **Dynamic Visuals**
Procedural graphics enable:
- Real-time color shifting based on game state
- Infinite visual variations
- Smooth animations without sprite sheets
- Resolution-independent rendering

### 4. **Performance**
- No texture loading overhead
- GPU-accelerated vector rendering
- Efficient memory usage
- Fast startup time

### 5. **Learning Opportunity**
Perfect for understanding:
- Computer graphics fundamentals
- Color theory and gradients
- Animation mathematics
- Real-time rendering pipelines

## 🔧 Procedural Physics System

### Movement Algorithm

The game uses **parametric curve-based movement** for smooth, predictable orb paths:

```python
# Path generation using sinusoidal waves
for i in range(num_segments):
    progress = i / num_segments
    x = start_x + (end_x - start_x) * progress
    wave = sin(progress * π * 3) * amplitude
    y = start_y + wave
```

### Key Physics Components

1. **Delta Time Integration**
   - Frame-rate independent movement
   - `position += velocity * deltaTime`
   - Ensures consistent speed across all hardware

2. **Velocity Vectors**
   - 2D vector mathematics using `QPointF`
   - Directional movement: `(cos(angle), sin(angle)) * speed`
   - Smooth projectile trajectories

3. **Collision Detection**
   - Circle-to-circle collision using distance formula
   - `distance = sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²)`
   - Collision when `distance < radius1 + radius2`

4. **Path Following**
   - Orbs follow pre-calculated spline curves
   - Distance-based positioning along path
   - Maintains spacing between orbs using constraint solver

5. **Interpolation**
   - Smooth position updates between path points
   - Linear interpolation (lerp) for position
   - Easing functions for animations

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Separation of Concerns
Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- **games/**: Pure gameplay mechanics
- **ui/**: Visual presentation only
- **logic/**: Game rules and calculations
- **services/**: Shared utilities

### State Management
Centralized state machine prevents bugs:
```
MAIN_MENU → PLAYING → PAUSED → PLAYING
                    ↓
                GAME_OVER → MAIN_MENU
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
Qt signals/slots for clean communication:
- State changes emit signals
- UI components react to signals
- Decoupled components

## 📦 Building Executables

### Using PyInstaller

Create a standalone executable:

```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "AncientTiger" main.py

# Find executable in dist/ folder
```

**Advanced options:**
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile \
            --windowed \
            --name "AncientTiger" \
            --icon=icon.ico \
            --add-data "README.md:." \
            main.py
```

### Using Nuitka (Better Performance)

Compile to native code for faster execution:

```bash
# Install Nuitka
pip install nuitka

# Compile (Windows)
python -m nuitka --standalone --windows-disable-console --enable-plugin=pyside6 main.py

# Compile (Linux/macOS)
python -m nuitka --standalone --enable-plugin=pyside6 main.py
```

**Benefits of Nuitka:**
- 2-3x faster startup
- Better runtime performance
- Smaller file size
- Native machine code
