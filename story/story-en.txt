Ancient Tiger: The Black Hole Escape

As the galaxy begins to lose its balance,
an ancient black hole opens at the edge of the solar system.

It's no ordinary black hole.

This is the Black Hole of Return—an ancient cosmic artifact that only appears when the Earth's core energy begins to collapse.

Prologue – The Forgotten Temple

Long before humanity knew science,
an ancient civilization—much like the cosmic Maya—built a temple to maintain the balance of the universe.

The temple is not on Earth,
but somewhere between dimensions, floating in space.

Therein resides the Ancient Tiger.

An ancient tiger,
not a purely physical being,
but a guardian of the aura of life.

It does not age.

It does not die.

It waits.

Main Menu – When It All Begins

On the main screen, the player sees:

The Ancient Tiger stands still

The ancient temple hovers behind it

Energy symbols rotate slowly like a cosmic clock

This is no decoration.

It was the final seal holding back destruction.

But that seal… began to crack.

Crisis – Earth's Energy Threatened

At the center of the Earth, there is the Aura Core —
a pure energy that keeps:

gravity stable

life growing

time flowing normally

When the primordial Black Hole awakened,
the Aura Core was pulled out of Earth.

If the aura were lost:

Earth would die

Time would shatter

Dimensions would collapse

---

The Bringer of Hope

The Ancient Tiger could not leave the temple.
If it moved, the seal would instantly collapse.

So the final messenger was chosen.

A tiger cub —
not yet as powerful as its guardian,
but possessed of pure courage.

He was not alone.

He rode an ancient flying turtle,
the oldest creature to understand:

cosmic pathways

energy flows

and how to penetrate black holes without being destroyed.

The turtle was not a vehicle.

He was a guide between dimensions.

Game Scene – Escape Through the Cosmos

The launcher is not a weapon.
It is a ritual of release.

Each shot is:

an attempt to break through the distortion

a leap towards safety

one step away from total destruction

In space:

asteroids move according to invisible laws

wild energy forms dangerous patterns

paths are never the same

Because the universe is never static.

---

True Meaning

The ultimate enemy is not asteroids.

Not obstacles.

The enemy is imbalance.

And each cub's launch is:

> a small struggle to save something much larger than itself.

---

Epilogue – The Guardian Awaits

The Ancient Tiger remains standing in his temple.
Watching from afar.

If the cub succeeds:

the aura returns

the seal is restored

the universe breathes again

If it fails…

Then the Black Hole Escape is no longer an escape,
but the beginning of a new destruction.
